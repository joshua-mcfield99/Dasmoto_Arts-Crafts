# Dasmoto_Arts-Crafts
A Codecademy project By Josh Mcfield

In this project I have been given the task of creating a arts and crafts sight from a plan provided by Codcademy.
I will use the following code languages:
- HTML
- CSS

I have made some minor adjustments to the styling to make it look better and be more responsive,
I have also added a footer with some infomation as to how to contact me, but here is my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-mcfield-366875222/

take a look at my git here: https://github.com/joshua-mcfield99

I hope you enjoy looking through this code and page as much as i enjoyed making it.
