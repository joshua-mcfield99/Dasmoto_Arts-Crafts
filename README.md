In this project I have been given the task of creating a arts and crafts sight from a plan provided by Codcademy.
I will use the following code languages:
- HTML
- CSS

take a look at my git here: https://github.com/joshua-mcfield99

I hope you enjoy looking through this code as much as i enjoyed making it.
